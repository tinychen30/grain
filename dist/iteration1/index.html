                            or &ldquo;we&rdquo;), is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read
                            the following to learn what information we collect from you (the &ldquo;User&rdquo;)
                            and how we use that information. If you have any questions about our privacy policy,
                            please email us at <a href="mailto:support@pijons.com">support@pijons.com</a>.</p>

                            PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU
                            ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS

                            <br />
                            We reserve the right to modify our privacy policy at any time, so please review
                            it frequently. If we make material changes to our privacy policy, we will post the
                            changes on this Privacy Notice.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</strong>
                            <br />
                            We collect two types of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable
                            User Information and Non-Personally User Identifiable Information.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Personally Identifiable User Information</strong>
                            <br />
                            Personally Identifiable User Information is information that identifies a specific
                            User. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as creating an
                            account, ordering a service from us, filling out a survey, sending us feedback,
                            requesting information about our services, (collectively, &ldquo;Personal Identification
                            Activities&rdquo;), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself.
                            It is optional for you to engage in a Personal Identification Activity. If you elect
                            to engage in a Personal Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide
                            us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first name, last
                            name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, and/or telephone number.
                            When you order services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card
                            number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. Depending
                            on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as
                            mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory
                            information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted
                            to engage in that activity.</p>
                        <p>
                            We use Personally Identifiable User Information to provide services to you, enhance
                            the operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze
                            Website use, improve our service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third
                            parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our
                            customer service an email we may use your name (first name and first letter of your
                            last name), your city, and comments and feedback in our marketing materials or on
                            our Website. In addition, if you use our Website to send reminders, and/or information
                            to another person, we may store your personal information. We may also use Personally
                            Identifiable User Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative
                            tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms
                            of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law
                            enforcement activities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Non-Personally User Identifiable Information</strong>
                            <br />
                            Non-Personally Identifiable User Information is information that does not identify
                            a specific User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource
                            Locator (&ldquo;URL&rdquo;) of the website you visited before coming to our Website,
                            the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser
                            you are using and your Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address. We, and/or
                            other persons who perform services for us (our authorized &ldquo;Third Party Service
                            Providers&rdquo;), may automatically collect this information when you visit our

                            <br />
                            We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security
                            of Personally Identifiable User Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable
                            User Information on our Website through a password and your email address. This
                            password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone.
                            In addition, your Personally Identifiable User Information resides on a secure server
                            that only selected personnel have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information
                            using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable
                            User Information is safe as it is transmitted to us.

                            Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can
                            be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable
                            security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the
                            same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from
                            the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may
                            receive any such information.</p>

                            cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User&rsquo;s
                            computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User.
                            We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are,
                            and track and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience.
                            Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable User Information from
                            you, like which pages you visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this information
                            helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. Most browsers
                            automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings
                            to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies, some

                            We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons
                            to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third
                            Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons
                            are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails
                            that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you
                            access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate
                            a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure
                            and improve our understanding of User traffic and behavior on our Website, as well
                            as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance.
